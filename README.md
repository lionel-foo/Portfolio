# Projects

### Emotion-centric music video recommendation system
- Created a proof of concept that will analyse YouTube users’ comments to discern their emotional state and subsequently recommend Youtube music videos. These recommendations aim to either resonate with the users’ current emotional state or aid them in navigating through negative emotions.
- Dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/emotions) was used to develop classification models to predict emotions derived from text data.
- **Tools and Technologies used:**
  Pandas | NLP | RNN | GloVe | BERT | Recommender Systems | Streamlit


### Hate Speech Detection
- Dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset) was used to develop a classification model that identify offensive and hateful text.
- A proof of concept was created using Optical Character Recognition (Tessaract) to detect hateful text in images.
- **Tools and Technologies used:**
  Pandas | NLP | RNN | GloVe | Streamlit | Computer Vision


### Predictive Model for HDB Resale Prices
- Developed a machine learning model with an emphasis on price prediction accuracy for HDB resale customers.
- Performed feature engineering, with an exhaustive optimisation of polynomial features to enhance the accuracy of predictions.
- **Tools and Technologies used:**
  Pandas | Linear Regression | Regularisation | Feature Engineering | Matplotlib | Seaborn


### Predicting pro/anti-AI posts
- Binary classification model to explore and predict either of two Subreddit threads that a given social media post related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) may belong to.
- Data was scraped from 2 Subreddits: r/DefendingAIArt and r/ArtistHate using [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) API.
- **Tools and Technologies used:**
  Pandas | NLP | Web Scraping | MultinomialNB | Logistic Regression | Count Vectoriser

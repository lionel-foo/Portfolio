that you might find If I'm down on my knees again Deep down way down, Lord, I try I try to follow your light
but it's nighttime Please, don't leave me in the end There's darkness in the distance I'm begging for forgiveness But I know I might resist it oh Oh I love it and hate it at the same time You and I drink the poison

r1AzafxuijY,"I've been wanting you to have this what is it? They key to my heart The key to your heart
Opens up a place I’m not safe in  I got locked away in its vacance
Waking up to all to all of your faces  Trapped inside this cage
Narcissistic bouts of rage  Accusations everyday  Arguments that you’d create 
to break the soul inside of me Trapped inside your cage
it was a crazy place to be  The constant roller coasters
made me sick I couldn’t see  the beauty in your lies had made the truth so ugly 
the man inside the mirror wasn’t recognizing me  A puppet master, pulling strings
and playing with my head  manipulating everything
and twisting what I said  projecting all your malice
then attacking me and  claiming my defense was
starting all the arguments.  As time goes on, and I embrace
the situation I just faced  I forgive myself for letting faith,
you’d change distort reality. The key to your heart
Opens up a place I’m not safe in  I got locked away in its vacance
Waking up to all to all of your faces  Trapped inside this cage
Narcissistic bouts of rage  Accusations everyday  Arguments that you’d create 
to break the soul inside of me  Every night we argue
I feel more and more abused  I give you what you want
but you’re still mad and I’m confused  you tell me that you’re leaving
she’s a villain on the loose  but even after everything
I still come after you  You told me this was forever
it’s me and you together  come to find out it never is oh
cause those were lies lies lies  she’s a snake in disguise
as bad as I would want you to  I know you’ll never change
Crazy you and I were  talking bout’ our wedding day
And I’m glad that we didn’t go through  with it, but I’m feeling so bad
for the next one you ruin with The key to your heart
Opens up a place I’m not safe in  I got locked away in its vacance
Waking up to all to all of your faces  Trapped inside this cage
Narcissistic bouts of rage  Accusations everyday  Arguments that you’d create 
to break the soul inside of me I still sort of miss it
your toxic ambition,  your evil intention
you’re wrong intuition  I wasn’t complicit to our demise
I got locked away  and didn’t even do the crime
What do I do now? Where do I go?  How do I tell the next girl I am a broken soul?
it’s getting hard for me to breathe  The pain has brought me to my knees
I’m broken inside  I cannot describe
the thoughts that I get when I think of those   times I saw all of the signs I ignored them now I 
will be damaged this way for the rest of my life. The key to your heart
Opens up a place I’m not safe in  I got locked away in its vacance
Waking up to all to all of your faces  Trapped inside this cage
Narcissistic bouts of rage  Accusations everyday  Arguments that you’d create 
to break the soul inside of me"

wiggling the vision heat heat waves
i’m swimming in a mirror]] sometimes, all i think about is you late nights in the middle of june heat waves been faking me out can’t make you happier now usually i put
something on tv so we never think
about you and me but today i see
our reflections clearly in hollywood
laying on the screen you just need a better life than this you need something I can never give fake water all across the road it’s gone now the night has come but sometimes, all i think about is you late nights in the middle of june heat waves been faking me out can’t make you happier now you can’t fight it
you can’t breathe you say something so loving but now I’ve got to let you go you’ll be better off in someone new i don’t wanna be alone you know it hurts me too you look so broken when you cry one more and then i’ll say goodbye sometimes, all i think about is you late nights in the middle of june heat waves been faking me out can’t make you happier now i just wonder what you’re dreaming of when you sleep and smile so comfortable i just wish that I could give you that that look that’s perfectly un-sad sometimes, all i think about is you late nights in the middle of june heat waves been faking me out
heat waves been faking me out sometimes, all i think about is you late nights in the middle of june heat waves been faking me out can’t make you happier now"

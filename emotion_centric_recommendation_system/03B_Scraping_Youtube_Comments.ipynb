I could use many explanitives that you've heard before, but the words, the music and the video is something I've NEVER WITNESSED BEFORE.  I MUST ADMIT, I've NEVER watched one of your videos before, but if I did, it's been awhile ago.  I can tell you are in great shape, and I mean that in all honesty.  Personally, I've been FORCED to suspend my VASA spa contract because of COVID, and I can't go mountain-biking (here in Utah) or play Olympic Table Tennis either because I have some operations to deal with, so I can appreciate you being in shape.\\n   I've had/have an idea for you, and only YOU can do this.  I would like to see you make a song/video which would be an answer to your dad's song ACHEY BREAKY HEART.  If I were your dad, I would be TOUCHED!  I don't know if you've had this in mind before, but I've had it in my mind just recently.  What Say You?!  And a VERY WARM CONGRADULATION for winning your very FIRST GRAMMY!</td>\n",

       "3   Ms. Miley,\\n   I have alot of mixed emotions while watching your video.  I could use many explanitives that you've heard before, but the words, the music and the video is something I've NEVER WITNESSED BEFORE.  I MUST ADMIT, I've NEVER watched one of your videos before, but if I did, it's been awhile ago.  I can tell you are in great shape, and I mean that in all honesty.  Personally, I've been FORCED to suspend my VASA spa contract because of COVID, and I can't go mountain-biking (here in Utah) or play Olympic Table Tennis either because I have some operations to deal with, so I can appreciate you being in shape.\\n   I've had/have an idea for you, and only YOU can do this.  I would like to see you make a song/video which would be an answer to your dad's song ACHEY BREAKY HEART.  If I were your dad, I would be TOUCHED!  I don't know if you've had this in mind before, but I've had it in my mind just recently.  What Say You?!  And a VERY WARM CONGRADULATION for winning your very FIRST GRAMMY!   \n",

But her fame is SO manufactured..... it's almost sickening. Almost like they planned \"Hannah Montana\" becoming reality, since the 1st episode of that show. Much as I like her, she's too manufactured for me to fully enjoy. Same goes for Taylor Swift. And not to bring race into it, but them both being caucasian brings yet more suspicion to the topic. For me at least. \\n\\nStill talented though, either way. And I do like this song (granted I would've liked this song regardless who made it.... esp Lady Gaga who would've been a PERFECT fit for this song, no shade whatsoever. But it complements Miley's voice well too).   \n",

Much as I like her, she's too manufactured for me to fully enjoy. Same goes for Taylor Swift. And not to bring race into it, but them both being caucasian brings yet more suspicion to the topic. For me at least. \\n\\nStill talented though, either way. And I do like this song (granted I would've liked this song regardless who made it.... esp Lady Gaga who would've been a PERFECT fit for this song, no shade whatsoever.

But her fame is SO manufactured..... it's almost sickening. Almost like they planned \"Hannah Montana\" becoming reality, since the 1st episode of that show. Much as I like her, she's too manufactured for me to fully enjoy. Same goes for Taylor Swift. And not to bring race into it, but them both being caucasian brings yet more suspicion to the topic. For me at least. \\n\\nStill talented though, either way. And I do like this song (granted I would've liked this song regardless who made it.... esp Lady Gaga who would've been a PERFECT fit for this song, no shade whatsoever. But it complements Miley's voice well too).   \n",

Disappointment!  They were all victim music of one sort or another.  Nothing inspiring, nothing high energy.  Not a single one of them was worth a crap.  I guess they just reflect the world view of the artists.  Sad.  I feel sorry for the people who will live in the world they are creating with their music.   \n",

I could use many explanitives that you've heard before, but the words, the music and the video is something I've NEVER WITNESSED BEFORE.  I MUST ADMIT, I've NEVER watched one of your videos before, but if I did, it's been awhile ago.  I can tell you are in great shape, and I mean that in all honesty.  Personally, I've been FORCED to suspend my VASA spa contract because of COVID, and I can't go mountain-biking (here in Utah) or play Olympic Table Tennis either because I have some operations to deal with, so I can appreciate you being in shape.\\n   I've had/have an idea for you, and only YOU can do this.  I would like to see you make a song/video which would be an answer to your dad's song ACHEY BREAKY HEART.  If I were your dad, I would be TOUCHED!  I don't know if you've had this in mind before, but I've had it in my mind just recently.  What Say You?!  And a VERY WARM CONGRADULATION for winning your very FIRST GRAMMY!</td>\n",

       "3  Ms. Miley,\\n   I have alot of mixed emotions while watching your video.  I could use many explanitives that you've heard before, but the words, the music and the video is something I've NEVER WITNESSED BEFORE.  I MUST ADMIT, I've NEVER watched one of your videos before, but if I did, it's been awhile ago.  I can tell you are in great shape, and I mean that in all honesty.  Personally, I've been FORCED to suspend my VASA spa contract because of COVID, and I can't go mountain-biking (here in Utah) or play Olympic Table Tennis either because I have some operations to deal with, so I can appreciate you being in shape.\\n   I've had/have an idea for you, and only YOU can do this.  I would like to see you make a song/video which would be an answer to your dad's song ACHEY BREAKY HEART.  If I were your dad, I would be TOUCHED!  I don't know if you've had this in mind before, but I've had it in my mind just recently.  What Say You?!  And a VERY WARM CONGRADULATION for winning your very FIRST GRAMMY!   \n",

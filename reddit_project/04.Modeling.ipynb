Nonetheless the predictive accuracy of almost 70% by our model offers our stakeholders the opportunity for a quick categorical sensing well above the baseline chance of 50%.\n",

    "**1. Devote greater funding in these areas**:\n",
    "- Extension of our project into further research by **collecting/scraping more data across other social media platforms**, or other methods such as **in-depth interview/ focus groups/ surveys with artists and the public** to get more nuanced sentiments etc.\n",
    "- Programmes to **promote human artist-AI system collaboration**, not replacement, given emerging tools such as Stable Diffusion\n",
    "- Educational efforts to **raise awareness about AI’s impact on artists and other individuals** among other professionals such as curators, art-related tech developers etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Review potential concerns raised, i.e. review regulatory frameworks and establish ethical guidelines (Code of Practice):**\n",
    "- Better clarity around **intellectual property ownership of AI-generated artworks**\n",
    "- Safeguard individuals’ **privacy and training data** being fed into AI models\n",
    "- Encourage **ethical data sourcing practices** by other artists and developers\n",
    "- Requiring **disclosure** in the use of AI for artworks and training source used, if any\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. More public engagement to understand ground perspectives and offer reassurance over concerns:**\n",
    "- Industry stakeholders: artists, technology developers, art institutions\n",

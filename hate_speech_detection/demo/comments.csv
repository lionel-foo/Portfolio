You can't make radical change overnight.  It doesn't work that way.  And while I agree with you about Biden being an absolute failure, a lot of others don't.  As people on the left, we need to keep the pressure up.

Finally, change is something that starts from the bottom and goes up.  This is something the right understands, seeing as they've taken over school boards and city councils.  If you want to get people involved in leftist causes, the best place to start is to get engaged in local politics.  Attend city council meetings, talk to people about the mayor.  In local politics, you don't have to deal with three-hundred million people.  When people see they can make a change, they will unite over the bigger fish we need to fry.

Our representatives aren't based on proportions of party population like in some other countries. For example, say if you have a state with 20 representatives in the house of representatives and 10% of that state are democratic socialists, you wouldn't just get 2 democratic socialist representatives. We have districts (usually gerrymandered ones but that's a whole other conversation) with the roughly the same amount of people in them to make up the US house of representatives. States with more people get more districts. If you want to get a seat in the US house of representatives, you have to win in a specific district. Even if 10% of this hypothetical state is democratic socialists, they'd all have to live in similar areas to have any hope of winning an election. The US senate is just the same problem on a larger scale where you have to win the majority of a state. Even if a significant enough amount of people belonging to a 3rd party live in the US for it to make sense that they get a representative, they'd all have to make up the majority of a state to get any representation. Our presidential elections work in a similar way where if candidates get the majority of a state's vote (even if only by a slim margin), they win *all* of that state's votes.

The US went through two red scares in which having the most basic left wing ideas could get you arrested or on a watch list. For example, the FBI had a 1,100 page file on Albert Einstein becuase he wrote a book titled ""why socialism"" and was upstanding of Lenin.

Many peoples idea of communism is that when the communists take power everything will become fine and the state will care for you, no more working, no more worries. But you will still have to work. The states benefits don't come from the tree and this itself seems to put a lot of people away from communism becuase they seem to believe that once communism happens they can just do nothing. To quote Lenin ""he who does not work shall not eat"".

Communists and socialists want the same goal. A workers republic for and by the working class. Where the 1% doesn't get to dictate how the rest have to live. Commonly referred to as the dictatorship of the proleterian, becuase well, it's the proleterian making the decisions.

You'd have to be blind or completely far right to not see how awful a president Trump had been from 2016 to 2020.

I'm not saying Biden is a good president either. Far from it. Biden hasn't really done anything and it's been a year since his inauguration. But the reason he hasn't been able to do anything is because Republicans keep stifling any progression forward, as well as his own wants not aligning with what the people want.

A 2 party system is probably one of the worst ways to handle elections, and I'd personally like to do away with it. Once again, I *personally* didn't have a choice in the matter. In both of the presidential elections. Both candidates were awful in my eyes, but one was less awful than the other. Trump was the worst of them all, and I'm honestly shocked he made it as far as he did. He himself even said he wasn't thinking he would win and was confused on what to do when he did win.

i just wanted to state my perspective, and it’s informed by what i’ve heard from victims of colonial and white supremacist violence from the US. 

it feels similar to how little of a difference that it makes whether the DNC or the GOP are in power. they both support the inherently violent capitalist status quo, yet one is just a teensy bit better with being socially progressive rather than socially conservative… for mostly surface level support of queer people. often only white queer people.

Heck I remember having a debate about this with someone back in \~2021/22 where I remember the conversation going something like this:

* What happens if you elect a fully republican senate/house and as a thank you for your vote they get rid of social security?
* Well then those folks who aren't working wouldn't get any.
* Ok, but what happens if you elect them next year and they shut it off?
* It'll incentivize people to work. No more free lunch
* But what if they do it to you as well because it's the will of the voters?
* Well, I already paid into it, so I should be fine.
* You don't understand. What if they shut off yours because, once again, shutting it off is what you want.
* I'm sure they'll spare those of us on it.
* But what if they shut off yours because, once again, it's what you want them to do.
* Well they wouldn't because as I said, I already paid into it. It's the other folks that have to watch out. And if they do shut mine off, we know it was because the democrats poisoned the bill.

They legit couldn't imagine a world where the politicians would shut off theirs. Just a world where they keep theirs and shut off everyone elses. And if theirs *was* affected, it's because those dastardly democrats and those poor innocent republicans couldn't help it.",1,ionstorm20

Did some analysis work for a huge hospital system modeling multiple single payer, universal healthcare approaches. Worst case, it cut healthcare cost burdened on the insured by 40% across the board. That was worst case. And we didn't even look at things like all the excessive bonuses on the hospital system side that aren't needed when every person is guaranteed health coverage.

I don't think that their cultures are unworthy of preservation, if anything the opposite is true: it would be good if those cultures were to flourish again in this contemporary World.

let me elaborate as someone who is ACTUALLY familiar with the source material: literally the entire fellowship except for Gandalf (magic being) and sam, and almost every supporting character, are aristocrats from wealthy and powerful landed families,  and a kingdom like Aragorn's isn't even a country in a contemporary sense so much as a collection of titles to privately owned property where peasants are forced to work for his benefit and he makes all the rules. While Jackson's films present Aragorn has being somewhat of a ""drifter"" who is almost reluctant to claim his title,  the source material has him both eager and planning to do so, and virtually everything he does is a step taken towards fulfilling that ambition

Here's why you're wrong. I mean this is your own words. We aren't talking about a realistic depiction of monarchy. Hell, we're not even talking about a realistic depiction of governance at all. Aragorn is fighting against a force of pure evil. The closest we have to that in our world is fascism.

oh yea you better believe it, he is defending ""the west"" against armies of oriental brown people and swarthy half-trolls and elephant riders from the south and east who worship an evil God lmfao. dont forget tha the entire minas tirith sequence was directly inspired by the siege of Vienna! if anything tolkein is virtually a ""fascist dogwhistle"" by reddit standards  


>The closest we have to that in our world is fascism.

if you really want to have that conversation, personally id say communism edges out both fascism and monarchism in the ""most evil"" contest, with its twisted materialist ethics and rationalism which were virtually antithetical to the very concept of morality as we know it, to quote the German socialist and philosopher Karl Vörlander writing on his time with marx: “The moment anyone started to talk to Marx about morality, he would roar with laughter.” then theres the sheer scale of its in and out groupings which is used to make ""undesirables"" and ""counterrevolutionary elements"" out of almost every aspect of the human experience, and the sheer scale of the atrocities that flow from the combination of materialist ethics and prevalent out-group hatred aspect of it which would would make the fascist states blush",-2,-recalled-to-life-

The British told Dessalines that they would trade with Haiti and support their independence only if they did this - to strike a blow against France and prevent any possibility of trade or unity between Haiti and France (so the profit motive literally made the British want to kill all the whites on the island). And then even after Dessalines gave the order, the people didn't do anything to the whites - the massacre only happened when a French squadron appeared in the harbour again, because the last time France invaded to reinstate slavery, the whites on the island, even the ""good"" ones, supported them.

Rittenhouse was armed with an AR-15 style rifle and had joined a group of armed citizens in Kenosha who had said they were there to protect local businesses.[7][8] Photographic evidence reveals that prior to unrest unfolding, Rittenhouse and others had participated in cleaning graffiti from a high school close to the Kenosha County Courthouse.[9][10]

After a man chased him into a parking lot and grabbed the barrel of his rifle, Rittenhouse fatally shot him.[11][12][13] Rittenhouse fled and was pursued by a crowd. He then fatally shot a second man after the man struck Rittenhouse with a skateboard and tried to grab his rifle.[7][14][15] A third person approached Rittenhouse with his Glock pointed at him, but Rittenhouse shot and wounded the individual first.[14][16][17][18][19]”

1aihnxo,kovdhfo,Hormone blockers block sex hormones. When you stop taking blockers they stop blocking and the hormones do their thing again. Note that hormone blockers aren't the same thing as cross-sex hormones.,49,NemoTheLostOne
1aihnxo,kowfh2d,"Saying ""reversible"" makes it sound like an otherwise stable action had taken place (like men getting the tubes tied) but simply stopping the intake of the blockers will cause you to start going through puberty.",7,pbzeppelin1977
1aihnxo,kovibg6,"To give a very broad explanation, sex hormone production is primarily controlled by a biological mechanism called the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. The hypothalamus (the part of your brain that controls various 'automatic' bodily functions, such as temperature regulation etc.) releases 'pulses' of a signalling hormone called 'gonadotropin releasing hormone' (GnRH) which instructs your pituitary gland to release two other hormones (leutenising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, LH and FSH) which control the various functions of the gonads; the release of sex hormones, ovulation/spermatogenesis, etc. The whole system works as a self-regulating feedback loop; when concentrations of one hormone get to a certain level it signals changes in other parts of the system so that levels fluctuate (or are maintained) in a predictable manner.

Puberty blockers are GnRH agonists. This means that they stimulate the receptors that detect GnRH, essentially 'jamming' this mechanism. This causes an initial spike in primary sex hormone production, followed by the system shutting down; the pituitary no longer receives signals to produce its signalling molecules, and so the gonads stop producing their signals. It doesn't, however, destroy the system. GnRH agonists are normally administered as a depot injection, where a 'store' of the drug sits in an oily suspension in your subcutaneous fat and disperses out. Once the injection wears off, the process re-starts; I receive a decapeptyl injection every three months. In cases where for some reason the process did not kick back in naturally, other exogenous hormones can be used to kick-start it.

It's worth bearing in mind that hormonal contraception ultimately works in a similar way; it just jams the signalling axis at a different point. Taking hormonal contraceptives doesn't generally shut down your HPG axis permanently, and neither do GnRH agonists.

There *are* health risks associated with running without a primary sex hormone as an adult for protracted periods and there can be developmental consequences to delaying puberty too long, but those are both mitigated if puberty blockers are used properly; ie, for a few years before the trans child is competent to make the decision that they want to continue with their 'default' puberty or take cross-sex hormones. Ironically, the fear-mongering about 'irreversible decisions', making people wait till they're 18 and so on actually makes puberty blockers more problematic. They are in many ways a legal stopgap forced  on people by a transphobic medical system; a lot of trans teens would prefer to just start taking cross-sex hormones as early as possible. It's also ironic that there is so much concern about puberty blockers being 'experimental' since inducing puberty with exogenous hormones is something medical science is pretty competent on; delayed puberty is about 3x more common than being trans.",6,Quietuus

1aihnxo,kowz4jl,"Hormone blockers are for people who are actively going through puberty, or haven’t started it yet. Blockers will only delay puberty.

For trans youth, blockers will just buy them some time. It will prevent their body from receiving the unwanted hormones, or going through the “wrong” puberty. So the blockers won’t make anyone look more feminine; if anything, it would make them look prepubescent, depending on when they stared blockers.

Eventually their doctor will discontinue the blockers prescription, and start actual HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) once the doctor and patient are confident in their decision. Alternatively, the patient could decide to not go through HRT for whatever reason. Then they would discontinue the blockers and puberty would naturally start up again.

The theory of marginal cost resolves this issue (not without its own problems), but this was after Marx. 

Marx's foundations do not at all stem from ideology. Moreover, Marx's first main contribution to economic theory was showing that, even in a perfect system where every item is in supply according to its demand, profit can still be made via the wage-labor system. His idea of ""labor exploitation"" was not some axiomatic belief, it was derived via the same models used by the economists of the day. 

I'm honestly not sure where your ""understanding"" of this subject comes from. You don't have to like Marx's analysis nor the labor theory of value. I don't even like the labor theory of value. However, if you're going to raise objections, they need to be thought out.",2,AlchemistAnalyst

They hear voices (of God).

I just don't get it when I hear a right winger tell me socialist ideals are only idealistic, and they have a true sense of reality. While they go to Church and believe in a book written by some men written in the first century as a moral compass to revolve their life around. Which they generally follow poorly in favor of Capitalism.
I even hear them complain about consequences of capitalism in their own life, but the idea that it could be improved upon looks like an impossibility to them.  Like Capitalism is a law of nature to them.
Humanity has to always be and has been progressing to get us to where we are today, but these people just drag their heels and fall for their Capitalist Masters propaganda.

The self-defence of the proletariat is paramount. Do not let bourgeois partisan politics turn you against the material needs of the working class. Do not follow liberals in placing the blame of fascist terrorists upon the tools they use to commit terror, rather than the ideology that drives them.

This subreddit unequivocally supports the right of all proletariats to arm themselves. Any suggestion that we should disarm is a violation of Rule 2.

It is a fact that the black community was targeted by the CIA with Cocaine and then later on, they were over-policed and incarcerated. First of all, black communities exist because of gentrification. Black people being poorer means that they are concentrated in the poorer parts of town.

The police go wherever the crime is, but also crime can only be caught where the police focus on. The more you target and harass black people, the more black people you catch. Meanwhile, white people are under-policed because whites commit fewer crimes. 


White people make up the vast majority of drug users but most of the people in prison for drug charges are black. Millions of people were sent to jail for possession of marijuana, many of them black. This was not because black people smoked more marijuana than whites, but because they got searched more often. Also you have to realize that many of these people being sent to jail are breadwinners, thousands of black families were destroyed for a law that is legal today. 

Couple that with the underfunded schools in black communities, many kids growing up there can't just “go to college and get a job”, and even if they get in, their family probably relies on them to make money ASAP, not spend 4 years in a campus taking lectures. What do you do if you need fast money with no skills whatsoever? drugs.

Most black people don't commit violent crimes and most white people don't commit mass shootings. If white people make up 60% of the population then that's 180 million people and only 80 individuals from that group actually did a mass shooting. A better thing to focus on would be ""why do people do mass shootings"" rather than what the race of the people doing mass shootings is. Similarly, we should be asking ourselves ""why do people commit violent crimes?"" rather than focusing on the race of the people who have commit violent crimes. In most cases mass shooters have mental health problems, and violent crime is usually related to poverty. Both of those issues are caused by systemic problems, mental health is expensive because the American healthcare system is trash, and as for poverty there's rampant income inequality for a myriad of different reasons and it's not getting any better, if anything it's only getting worse. Also it's important to note that income inequality disproportionately affects black people because of systemic racism that has existed in the past or continues to exist today.

By identifying these things, we can start to create a plan of attack for addressing and stopping the murders. When we see that group X is committing the majority of the murders, despite being a small minority of the population, then that allows us to make a step in the right direction for solving problems. Now that we've identified where a large portion of the murder is coming from, the next step is to find out why group X is committing the murder. This could be because of a multitude of reasons, potentially including the ones you listed. Now we address these reasons and make changes in society in order to reduce the murder. See how this all starts at step 1? We need each step in order to solve our problems. We can't just ignore step 1 because it's taboo or uncomfortable to talk about.",2,Gorillerz

I'll check your links but it's going to be hard to convince me that illegals *displacing Americans from jobs (starting in the mid-1960s) such that those Americans now need to compete for the jobs that remain*, doesn't result in depressed wages.  Illegals don't consume at the same rates as citizens do, and they also don't contribute as much to the tax base as they cost (I'm betting) since many get paid below the table and don't pay taxes at all, while consuming benefits like section 8 housing assistance and food stamps, while using our schools for their kids.

>Here’s the problem with the current immigration debate: Neither side is revealing the whole picture. Trump might cite my work, but he overlooks my findings that the influx of immigrants can potentially be a net good for the nation, increasing the total wealth of the population. Clinton ignores the hard truth that not everyone benefits when immigrants arrive. For many Americans, the influx of immigrants hurts their prospects significantly.

**This second message might be hard for many Americans to process, but anyone who tells you that immigration doesn’t have any negative effects doesn’t understand how it really works. When the supply of workers goes up, the price that firms have to pay to hire workers goes down. Wage trends over the past half-century suggest that a 10 percent increase in the number of workers with a particular set of skills probably lowers the wage of that group by at least 3 percent. Even after the economy has fully adjusted, those skill groups that received the most immigrants will still offer lower pay relative to those that received fewer immigrants.**

> **Both low- and high-skilled natives are affected by the influx of immigrants. But because a disproportionate percentage of immigrants have few skills, it is low-skilled American workers, including many blacks and Hispanics, who have suffered most from this wage dip. The monetary loss is sizable. The typical high school dropout earns about $25,000 annually. According to census data, immigrants admitted in the past two decades lacking a high school diploma have increased the size of the low-skilled workforce by roughly 25 percent. As a result, the earnings of this particularly vulnerable group dropped by between $800 and $1,500 each year.**
>
> **We don’t need to rely on complex statistical calculations to see the harm being done to some workers. Simply look at how employers have reacted. A decade ago, Crider Inc., a chicken processing plant in Georgia, was raided by immigration agents, and 75 percent of its workforce vanished over a single weekend. Shortly after, Crider placed an ad in the local newspaper announcing job openings at higher wages. Similarly, the flood of recent news reports on abuse of the H-1B visa program shows that firms will quickly dismiss their current tech workforce when they find cheaper immigrant workers.**

*And here is likely where your study gets its idea of the overall economic impact being positive... the issue being **it's positive for the people employing the immigrants, at the expense of everyone else**.

>**But that’s only one side of the story. Somebody’s lower wage is always somebody else’s higher profit. In this case, immigration redistributes wealth from those who compete with immigrants to those who use immigrants—from the employee to the employer. And the additional profits are so large that the economic pie accruing to all natives actually grows. I estimate the current “immigration surplus”—the net increase in the total wealth of the native population—to be about$50 billion annually. But behind that calculation is a much larger shift from one group of Americans to another: The total wealth redistribution from the native losers to the native winners is enormous, roughly a half-trillion dollars a year.**

EDIT: how does the wealth transfer seem doubtful to you?  Who do you think gets the lion's share of the benefit of cheaper labor?  Hint: it's not the consumer.",-3,pdoherty972
1agde4c,koj65qn,"> The jobs that they're taking are typically lower wage jobs in fields where a lower cost of labour translates into cheaper goods for consumers.

X jobs need to be done.  Adding some illegals who live 5 to a one-bedroom apartment and send 50% of their pay home isn't a big enough increase in demand to offset the reduced jobs and wages they cause, nor does it compensate for the public taxpayer money they use in the form of schooling, welfare, food stamps and housing assistance (where they use them).

And we already get cheap goods from overseas, where cheap labor undercutting US jobs and wages belongs (if it truly belongs anywhere), since those people aren't directly taking jobs from inside our country, and aren't consuming taxpayer services.
